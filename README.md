Version numbering
=================
Versions are numbered `major.minor.patch`
Patches shouldn't break anything, and are just bug fixes.
Minor versions may break compatibility, but it's unlikely.
An even minor version is a stable release.
An odd minor version is a bleeding-edge/in progress version.
Major versions can and will break compatability with previous versions, cause they are usually complete rewrites.
